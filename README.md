![Controller](assets/title.png)

Welcome to my "Character Controller" repository! Here I am experimenting with managing entities on a canvas.

This repository is for educational purposes and to share and document my approach.
Feel free to explore, modify, and use any code you find here for your own learning and
projects.

The current progress is deployed as https://character-controller-henna.vercel.app/, but might change at any point,
since this is very much a playground.

## What's the current state of the project?

Right now it is nothing more than a player controller on a canvas; but you can already move them around with arrow
keys, and trigger a sword swing on space, so that's something...
